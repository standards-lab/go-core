// Package graph is a typed dependency graph. A [Graph] describes [Node]
// values inertly, each a name and a constructor; [Graph.Build] constructs
// what its roots reach and returns it as a [System] of [Dependency] values
// in computed layers. The package knows nothing of lifecycles: a consumer
// that runs a System, starting its layers in order and stopping them in
// reverse, reads each node's part from its value.
//
// The package exports:
//
//   - [Graph], the description of the nodes, and [New], which returns an
//     empty one
//   - [Graph.Define], which adds a node with its constructor and runs
//     nothing
//   - [Graph.Replace], which swaps a node's constructor before Build, for a
//     test's substitute
//   - [Graph.Observe], which adds a function a Build calls with each node's
//     name as it begins to construct it, for tracing what a Build reaches
//   - [Graph.Build], which constructs what the roots reach into a System
//   - [Node], a typed handle on one node, and [Node.Name], its name
//   - [Ref], any Node whatever its type, sealed to Node, and its Name
//   - [Scope], what a constructor receives
//   - [Scope.Use], which returns a dependency's value, building it if
//     needed
//   - [Scope.After], which orders the node after another without its value
//   - [System], what one Build constructed
//   - [System.Get], which returns a node's value
//   - [System.Layers], which returns the built nodes in layers
//   - [Dependency], one built node: its name and value
//
// # Discovery
//
// A constructor declares its dependencies by using them: [Scope.Use] builds
// the dependency if this Build has not, and records the edge, so the edges
// are discovered as the constructors run, depth-first from the roots, and
// can depend on what the constructors see. Each node is built at most once
// per Build, so a node shared by several dependents is constructed once and
// they all receive its value. A node that is neither a root nor reached by
// a Use is never constructed, so a Build of a subset of the roots brings up
// only that subset's dependencies. Each Build is independent and constructs
// fresh values.
//
// [Scope.After] adds an order-only edge: it passes no value and builds
// nothing, and holds only when its target is in the System by some other
// path.
//
// # Layers
//
// The layers are the longest-path layering of the discovered Use and After
// edges, as [System.Layers] states: every node's dependencies sit in lower
// layers, so the nodes of one layer can start together once the layers
// below them have.
//
// # Errors and panics
//
// A constructor's error fails the Build, labelled with its node's name and
// wrapping the error; a failing dependency aborts every constructor whose
// Use reached it, and Build reports the dependency's error.
//
// [Scope.Use] returns the dependency's value itself, so the abort unwinds
// by panic, which Build recovers. A constructor must not recover it: one
// that returns, with a value or an error, after a Use it made aborted would
// lose the failure, so Build panics naming the constructor and the Use.
//
// Wiring mistakes panic with a "graph: " message, as each symbol's
// documentation states: a dependency cycle, a node used on a Graph it was
// not defined on, a Scope used after its constructor returned, a recovered
// abort, a Define or Replace after Build, a Get of a node not in the
// System, a nil constructor or observer, and an empty or duplicate name.
// Build checks its roots, for a nil node or one defined on another Graph,
// before it constructs any of them, so a mistake in any root panics before
// a constructor runs.
